What that means for RDKit is that mostly all the functionality of rdkit is written around the `Mol` object, short for molecule. \n",

They are similar to [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), which are used to match text patterns.  In SMARTS, you can search for things like \"any aromatic atom\" or \"sp2 hybridized carbons not bonded to nitrogen\".  They range very coplex to simple. "
