    "\n",
    "The [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Overview.html#) is a open-source Python library for doing chemistry in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not necessary to understand fully understand object-oriented programming in order to use the RDKit, but its necessary to understand that chemicals (more often referred to as molecules) are objects.  Objects in Python are things that share common features in order to save code.  What that means for RDKit is that mostly all the functionality of rdkit is written around the `Mol` object, short for molecule. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we create a `Mol` object, we know we'll be able to do perform certain functionalities on that object.  For example, every molecule has atoms, therefore every `Mol` object has the ability to retrieve the number of atoms in the underlying chemical through the `GetNumAtoms()` function that every `Mol` object has.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, once we create a `Mol` object from the chemical we are interested in, we'll have the entire functionality of RDKit at out fingertips.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we create a `Mol` object?  There are tons of ways.  We can create them from strings of chemical structure annotations as we learned in Lab 2.  The most common are SMILES and InChI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create benzene and asprin from SMILES and InChI, respectively. "

    "\n",
    "You can make queries on molecules and search for certain structures.  One way of doing this is by using [SMARTS](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html). SMARTS are a chemical text language similar to SMILES except for generalizing more abstract chemical concepts.  They are similar to [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), which are used to match text patterns.  In SMARTS, you can search for things like \"any aromatic atom\" or \"sp2 hybridized carbons not bonded to nitrogen\".  They range very coplex to simple. "
