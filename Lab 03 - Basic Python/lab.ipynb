    "## The Python Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages.  Additionally, it is arguably the preferred languages for doing data science, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics.  The other language in that argument, the R statistical programming language is also quite popular and has many of the same benefits that makes Python great for data science.  However, Python's growth in the last decade or so, coupled with it's open-source community and many open-source libraries particular for the life sciences, has potentially given it the lead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, and R, are interpretted languages, rather than compiled languages like (C, C++, etc.).  In both circumstances, progamming lanuages are used to instruct the computer what to do by getting converted to machine code.  In compiled code however, they must be first compiled in one step and interpretted in ther other.  Interpretted languages on the other hand do this at run time, allowing you to immeidately see the results (at the cost of some other performance factors, not necessarily of concern to data scienctists, bioinformaticians and cheminformaticians).  This means you can quickly do computational tasks and see the results immediately.  It also allows for things like [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) which is what we will use for this course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks have been referred to as [\"The Scientific Paper of the Future\"](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/).  They are widely used by data scientists and the like and allow for a combination of text, photos, plots, and other media with programming code (Jupyter stands for Julia, Python and R, the three languages it has support for).  They are great for tutorials which is why we will use them in this course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core fundamentals of Python as a data science languages are its strong libraries for data science, visualizaition and cheminforamtics.  After exploring the basics of programming, we will overview four libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a data analytics library that allows for fast computational on data matricies, a core component of statstics and data science.  \n",

    "\n",

    "For example, we can look at the famous [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).  The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (_Iris setosa_, _Iris virginica_ and _Iris versicolor_). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features.  In the original collection, Dr. Ronald Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other and thus it became a widely used dataset for tutorials.  In this dataset, every row is a datapoint (the four measurements and the species). \n",
