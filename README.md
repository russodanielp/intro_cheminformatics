# Introduction



## Overview

A set of notebooks showing introduction to Python using rdkit, 

1) Course Introduction
#TODO: This is empty

2)  Introduction to chemical structure annotationsâ€“ 2D &3D
Teach structure annotations: ChemBioOffice, SMILE, SDF and etc. First homework assignment
#TODO: This is empty

3) Basic Python, Pandas and matplotlib
Introducet the basics of programming using the Python language.  Introduce popular data science and visualization packages, Pandas and matplotlib.
