# Introduction

This repository contains a set of notebooks (organized into seperate topics by lab) for an introduction to cheminformatics in the Python programming language.  Introductions to programming using the Python programming language are included.  The notebooks rely on a set of both dependecies Python and other packages listed in the `environmental.yml`.  Thus, installing a Python environment using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is required.  Conda installation can be done as described on the [conda website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).  Some notebooks are taken from the incredible [Teach Open Computer-aided Drug Design](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd) course.  However, notebooks in this repository are geared to noive programmers.  

## Running the notebooks locally

After conda is properly installed, a new conda environment for these notebooks can be created by the command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n intro-chem 
```
The environment can then be activated by:
```bash
conda activate intro-chem
```
And the notebooks can be opened via:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
or 
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
