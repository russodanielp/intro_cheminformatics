# Introduction



## Overview

A set of notebooks showing introduction to Python using rdkit, 

1) Course Introduction
#TODO: This is empty

2)  Introduction to chemical structure annotationsâ€“ 2D &3D
Teach structure annotations: ChemBioOffice, SMILE, SDF and etc. First homework assignment
#TODO: This is empty

3) Basic python
Practicing python programming. Second paper assignment (graduate students only)
#TODO: Need to fill in the empties and maybe come up with some stuff on matplotlib

5) Advanced python and RDKit 
An introduction the cheminformatics Python module RDKit

4) Molecular Descriptors 
Generating chemical descriptors - explores the basics of generting molecular descriptors and chemical fingerprints  

6) Chemical similarity
The basics of chemical similarities using different metrics and descriptor spaces  

7) Machine Learning Part I - Unsupervised ML
The basics of unsupervised machine learning, including principal component analysis and chemical clustering  

8) Machine Learning Part I - QSAR
The basics of supervised machine learning and developing quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models

9) Data science in chemistry
Learning about web retrieval services and how to access chemistry databases via programmatic interfaces.  

10) Predictive modeling
#TODO: Maybe write a notebook that can be run on any dataset 

11) Pharmacophores
Generating pharmacophores 

12) Structural based drug discovery
The use of commercial cheminformatics tool-CASE Ultra
