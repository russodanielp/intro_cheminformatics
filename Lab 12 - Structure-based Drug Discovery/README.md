# Structure-Based Drug Discovery

In this lab, we will learn the basics of structure based drug discovery.  Using an open-source software SMINA we will re-dock the co-crystalized ligand from a crystal structure of the estrogen receptor alpha.  We will also download a set of compounds from ChEMBL with ERalpha activity, sample their conformations, and perform docking on a subset.
