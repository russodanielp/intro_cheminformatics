# Data Science in Chemistry

In this lab we will learn the role of large databases in chemistry.  We will learn the basics of programmatically accessing two chemical databases, PubChem and ChEMBl.  In PubChem, we will use it to query different molecule properties and identifiers.  In ChEMBL, we will use it to download bioactivity data for a particular biomolecular target.
